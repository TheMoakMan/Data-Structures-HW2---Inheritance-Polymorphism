Contrete class
Implement (via overriding) a custom exception function here which follows the standard std exception class style for including an error message.

When we call that standard message function, it should cout an error message:
    "Custom error has occured"
If you read the std exception documentation and examples I gave for the std expection, you will know *what* we are asking for ;)
