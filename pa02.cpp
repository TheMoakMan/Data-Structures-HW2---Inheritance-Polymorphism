/**
main
====

Solve the main input and output here.
Within the main loop of your program, you must use the same polymorphic pointer to an Operating_system to manage multiple objects of type Cluster and Personal_surveillance_device.
Do not reference the objects directly.
Note: only a small fraction of your cpp implementations are tested in main.
